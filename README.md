# Sketchspace - A drawing app

A demonstrative drawing app built in flutter by me

## Methods

- Using [LazyPainter](https://github.com/lalondeph/flutter_performance_painter) by Philip Lalonde for the rendering and drawing of CustomPainter strokes.
- Using a modified [Zoom Widget](https://github.com/semakers/zoom-widget/tree/master) for Handling the zoom and pan.
